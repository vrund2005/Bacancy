let’s talk about defer, because this is where understanding browsers makes you dangerous.
                 ~~~~~

When the browser reads HTML, it parses top to bottom. If it sees:

<script src="script.js"></script>

it stops everything, downloads the script, executes it, and only then continues parsing the page.
That means if your script tries to access elements that haven’t been parsed yet, they don’t exist. Boom. null.

defer changes the rules.

<script src="script.js" defer></script>
-> With defer:

The browser downloads the script in parallel
It waits to execute it until the HTML is fully parsed
Execution happens before DOMContentLoaded
So your DOM exists when the script runs.

That’s why your code works safely with:
const body = document.body

Without defer, if the script were in <head>, document.body might not exist yet.
Alternative solution? Put your script at the end of <body>. Old-school but valid.

Extra nerd bonus:
defer preserves execution order across multiple scripts. async does not. async executes as soon as the file finishes downloading, chaos-style.
Web browsers are basically orchestras. defer keeps them in rhythm.
